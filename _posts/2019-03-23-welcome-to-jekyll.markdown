To solve the conflict issue in github, follow these steps:  
1-Under your repository name, click  Pull requests.  
2-In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request with a merge conflict that you'd like to resolve.
3-Near the bottom of your pull request, click Resolve conflicts.   
4-Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge.  
5-If you have more than one merge conflict in your file, scroll down to the next set of conflict markers and repeat steps four and five to resolve your merge conflict.    
6-Once you've resolved all the conflicts in the file, click Mark as resolved.  
7-To merge your pull request, click Merge pull request. For more information about other pull request merge options, see "Merging a pull request."

```javascript
const Razorpay = require('razorpay');

let rzp = Razorpay({
	key_id: 'KEY_ID',
	secret: 'name'
});

// capture request
rzp.capture(payment_id, cost)
	.then(function (data) {
		return 2;
	})
```
